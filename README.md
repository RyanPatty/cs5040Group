Programming #1 (10 points)
Write your Java program named PrintReverseYourName as follows. The main method prompts the user to enter a string. The main method then passes the input string to method printCharsReverse(String str)to recursively print given string in reverse. Again, method printCharsReverse(String str) is a recursive method which print ‘one character’ for each invoke.


Format the outputs as follows. Test data shows values for illustration, user may enter values one per line. Test strings does not show input prompts. 

Test data:

Entered string:		Hello world    //Red characters are user input
Reversed string:		dlrow olleH
Try again(Y/N): 		Y

Entered string:		Data Structures and Algorithms
Reversed string:		smhtiroglA dna serutcurtS ataD
Try again(Y/N): 		N



Programming #2 (10 points)
Write a java program (name it AverageGradeYourName) as follows: The main method prompts the user to enter number of students in a class (class size is integer value), then prompts the user to enter the grades (between 0 and 100) into an array of type integer. The entered class size determines the array size. Next, the main method passes the filled array to method findAverage(…)to recursively determine and return the class average as a double value. Again, method findAverage(…)is a recursive method.

Format the outputs as follows. Shown input values are just for illustration, user may enter values one per line. Test data does not show input prompts.

Test data:

Class size:		3
Entered grades:		100 100 100
Class average:		100.00

Class size:		7
Entered grades:		50 75 80 80 40 35 85
Class average:		63.57

Class size:		8
Entered grades:		0 100 25 90 55 30 90 35
Class average:		53.13



Programming #3 (10 points)
Write your Java program named StarPatternYourName as follows. The main method prompts the user to enter a number of rows. Then passes the input string to method printPattern(…) to recursively print the pyramid stars. You can use recursive helper method if you need it. Also, you can add more methods.
Format the outputs as follows. Not only for 5, 7, your program should run correctly with the other integers.

 

Please carefully think about these.
Recursion to care about the number of spaces (left side of pyramid) and stars. 
Recursion to care about the number of stars of each line. (1, 3, 5, 7 …. stars)
Recursion to care about the number of lines.
You may need additional methods. If you use loops in printPattern and the other methods (except main method loop to retry), you will not get a full credit.
